<h1>seven</h1>
<p>We are the collective, we are seven.</p>

<h2>WE ARE NOT ONE</h2>
<p>
  In early 2020, we decided to leave <a href="https://tilde.one">one</a>, as they were too chaotic. We then
  decided to form the councel of seven for stability. Seven still lives in one, however.
</p>
<h2>WE ARE SEVEN</h2>
<p>
  The councel of Seven is composed of seven anonymous board members, however there are also a few other people.
  However this github account and other public relations is managed by only one of the board
  members, so take the contents of this site with a grain of salt.
